				I was accepted to the CPRIT-CURE Summer Undergraduate Program at MD Anderson in Houston. There, I conducted research in the Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Department with Anil Korkut, Ph.D. My Project was to implement a mathematical method to analyze with targeted therapies in order to identify the adaptive resistance in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells. 

				
				(make smaller? or like a more button)
				The goal of my project was to better understand the mechanisms of the adaptive resistance as well as discovering combination therapies to overcome the resistance. I used computational methods, pathway analysis, and biostatistics to address this problem. Once the adaptation mechanisms were identified, combination therapies were nominated with the intention of overcoming the resistance. I was successfully able to implement this method and was able to identify adaptive responses in melanoma cells. This technique could be used for patients with resistant melanoma to prescribe a unique therapy to fight their disease, similar to personalized medicine. I presented my work through a poster presentation. I thoroughly enjoyed this project and being involved with an institution such as MD Anderson. I am grateful to have been able to work alongside Dr. Korkut and many other scientists. I learned a great deal about complex pathway analysis, network modeling, biostatistics, as well as the intricate mechanics of resistance. This project had a clear clinical application by prescribing combination therapies to patients suffering from melanoma. I would also like to take my research a step further, and apply my own bioinformatics tools and research to patents in the clinic with the intention of curing their disease.

				The summer of 2016, I conducted research in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program at LSU Health Science Center School of Medicine in New Orleans. I was able to join through the Undergraduate Student Summer Research Program. I worked with Chindo Hicks, Ph.D. and director of the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program. Dr. Hicks’ lab focuses on bioinformatics and computational genomics, population genomics, translational genomics, and big data analytics. Working with Dr. Hicks enabled me to use my abilities as a bioinformatician in the field of medicine. I used gene expression data to determine specific genes that can predispose women to triple negative breast cancer. My findings have been curated into a manuscript, which is currently in the process of getting published. The current title is “An Integrative Genomics Approach for Associating GWAS Discoveries with Immunomodulation in Triple-negative Breast Cancer." Through this opportunity I was able to practice my abilities in different bioinformatics tools such as creating heatmaps, pathway analysis, data mining, and big data analytics. I enjoyed both my research and the opportunity to work in a dry lab. This initial experience in bioinformatics research has solidified my goal in obtaining a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.

				The summer following my first year, I was accepted to the LSU Health Science Center School of Medicine’s Undergraduate Student Summer Research Program in New Orleans. There I conducted physiological research under Patricia Molina, M.D., Ph.D. and Head of the Department of Physiology. Research in her department focuses on the impact of chronic alcoholism, drug abuse, and HIV/AIDS and its behavioral, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune consequences. I investigated the combined effects of chronic binge alcohol administration and simian immunodeficiency virus on cell apoptosis in the prefrontal cortex of Rhesus macaque monkeys. I measured this through western blots and staining. I found that the combined stimuli resulted in a significant increase in neuronal cell death, and I presented my findings through a poster presentation. Through this experience I learned how to conduct myself in a laboratory and to collaborate with other scientists and lab members for guidance. I also learned how to perform various experiments and handle lab rats. I enjoyed my experience in a web lab, and I would like to combine my bioinformatics tools with a wet lab component in the future.

				My very first year at Baylor University, I conducted research with Marty Harvill, Ph.D. Dr. Harvill has a Ph.D. in Zoology and is a senior lecturer of biology at Baylor. With him, I studied the soil fertility of the Lake Waco Wetlands. These wetlands are where a majority of the city collects its drinking water. The objective of this project was to test the fertility of the soil as an indicator of the quality of the water before it is treated. My project consisted of collecting soil samples from different regions and analyzing its contents. I found that there are significantly varying soil qualities throughout the different regions of the wetlands. I presented my findings through a poster presentation and a research paper. This was my first experience with research. I learned how to set up and conduct a research project in an organized approach. I also learned how write a research paper and how to present data through a poster presentation. I greatly enjoyed my first experience with research, and this project helped me solidify my interests in biology and research.

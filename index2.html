				I was accepted to the CPRIT-CURE Summer Undergraduate Program at MD Anderson in Houston. There, I conducted research in the Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Department with Anil Korkut, Ph.D. My Project was to implement a mathematical method to analyze with targeted therapies in order to identify the adaptive resistance in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells. 

				The goal of my project was to better understand the mechanisms of the adaptive resistance as well as discovering combination therapies to overcome the resistance. I used computational methods, pathway analysis, and biostatistics to address this problem. Once the adaptation mechanisms were identified, combination therapies were nominated with the intention of overcoming the resistance. I was successfully able to implement this method and was able to identify adaptive responses in melanoma cells. This technique could be used for patients with resistant melanoma to prescribe a unique therapy to fight their disease, similar to personalized medicine. I presented my work through a poster presentation. I thoroughly enjoyed this project and being involved with an institution such as MD Anderson. I am grateful to have been able to work alongside Dr. Korkut and many other scientists. I learned a great deal about complex pathway analysis, network modeling, biostatistics, as well as the intricate mechanics of resistance. This project had a clear clinical application by prescribing combination therapies to patients suffering from melanoma. I would also like to take my research a step further, and apply my own bioinformatics tools and research to patents in the clinic with the intention of curing their disease.
